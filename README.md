tasks for FDTD
0: Simulate a system with magnetic mirror boundary condition (H=0) on one
side and electric mirror (E= 0) on the other side. The source is a Gaussian
profile propagating to boundaries and back, source located exactly in the
center of the simulated domain. The successful presentation should provide
a sequence of images as a time evolution (or animation) for electric and
magnetic fields. The simulation should finish at the moment where the
electric field is vanished (all energy is in the magnetic field)

1, 2, 3: Provide absorbing (Mur ABC) and PML (simplified CPML) boundary
condition. Compare ABC with 5,10, and 20 cell PML.

4: Compare against Fresnel equations, find the limits of FDTD applicability.

5, 6: Compare against single dielectric slab (e.g
http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/ orfanidi/ewa/ch05.pdf), you should provide
simulation of reflection-less cases of a quarter-wavelength and
half-wavelength slab width cases.
